    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Hi there, I'm Jordan and this is my art website. I work as a web developer in Toronto so art is more of an on-the-side kinda thing for me. Currently, this site only serves as a gallery for my work, however, I am planning in the future to hunt down a good print shop, stock up on prints of my work, sign them and sell them here. Not needing to depend on my art for a living allows it to be a very genuine and special thing for me. I feel better and work better when I don't feel rushed. My body of work feels more like a living and naturally growing entity than just a simple collection of drawings.</p>

    <h2>Buying Original Work</h2>

    <p>I may not be selling prints yet but you can always send me a message and inquire about purchasing my original pieces. If you are interested, they range in price from $500.00 to $1,500.00 CAD so if that sounds doable, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">send me a message</a>.</p>

    <p>I appreciate any interest in my work, stay tuned for more to come.</p>
