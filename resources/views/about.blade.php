<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi there, I'm Jordan and this is my art website. Currently, it only serves as a place for me to post my original artwork and display it to the world. However, I am planning in the future to hunt down a good print shop, stock up on prints of my work, sign them and sell them. Then, this site will serve as a place for people to buy prints and even my original pieces.</p>

<p>More about me, I work as a web developer in Toronto. I do enjoy the relative predictability of programming. I'm sure lots of other coders would laugh maniacally at that statement but I'm refering to the fact that it's something that can be learned and there's documentation and other resources to help and one can always grow and learn.</p>

<p>Art is more of an on-the-side kinda thing for me. I never seriously considered becoming a professional artist because I don't have great stamina when it comes to drawing. I can only really do sprints of about an hour or two and then I don't feel like doing it again for a few days or weeks. Because of this, my larger drawings can take a few months, even up to half a year to complete. But I'm comfortable with this. Not relying on my art for a living allows it to be a very genuine thing for me. I feel better and work better when I don't feel rushed and my body of work feels more like a living and growing entity than a collection of drawings.</p>

<p>Anyway, for now, prints are coming at some point but you can always send me a message and inquire about purchasing my original pieces. If you are interested, you should know, they range from $500.00 to $1,500 CAD so if that sounds doable, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">send me a message</a>.</p>

<p>I appreciate any interest in my work and stay tuned for more to come.</p>
